RPC
===

Overview
~~~~~~~~

Synchronous communication with lymph services is realised through RPC calls. RPC messages
are handled through ØMQ. In lymph, RPC messages are not persistent and if a RPC call fails,
it is the responsibility of the calling code to deal with it.

.. note:: 

    In lymph terminology, messages are referring to synchronous RPC calls, and events are 
    asynchronous messages as described in :doc:`events`.


Registering methods as RPC callable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any class inheriting from :class:`lymph.Interface` can receive RPC calls. By specifying the
``name`` argument when initializing the class, the lymph service will be reachable through its
interface name ``name``.

By default the service is registered under the name given when you configure
the service.

.. code::

    import lymph

    class EchoService(lymph.Interface):
        pass


.. code-block:: yaml

    interfaces:
        echo:
            class: project.interfaces:EchoService

will be reachable with the service name ``echo``. This is the name with which lymph knows that
the RPC messages should be sent to ``EchoService``.

In order to make a method in a lymph interface class RPC callable, it is sufficient to
add the :func:`@lymph.rpc()` (or :func:`@lymph.raw_rpc` for accessing the channel object) decorator in
front of it.

.. decorator:: rpc()

    Marks the decorated interface method as an RPC method.
    
    .. code::
    
        import lymph
    
        class Example(lymph.Interface):
            @lymph.raw_rpc()
            def do_ack(self, channel, message):
                """
                HERE SOME FANCE HELP TEXT
                """
                assert isinstance(channel, lymph.core.channels.ReplyChannel)
                assert isinstance(message, lymph.core.messages.Message)
                channel.ack()

           @lymph.rpc()
           def echo(self, message):
               return message

If a docstring is specified after the RPC method definition, it will be used as a description
of the service and will be returned by ``lymph inspect``.

Difference between lymph.rpc and lymph.raw_rpc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+++++++++
lymph.rpc
+++++++++

The :func:`lymph.rpc` decorator is easier to understand compared to :func:`lymph.raw_rpc`
since the former work as any Python function where what ever the RPC function return will be sent
to the caller, as for exceptions there is two cases depending on the ``raises`` argument of
:func:`lymph.rpc` :

- If the exception raised inside the RPC function is an instance of a class that is part of the
  ``raises`` argument then the client will see a :exc:`RemoteError``.
- Else the result will be a **NACK**.


+++++++++++++
lymph.raw_rpc
+++++++++++++

When :func:`lymph.raw_rpc` is used the underlying method call has to have the following form:

.. code::

    def some_rpc_method(self, channel, **kwargs):
        …

The ``channel`` argument takes a :class:`lymph.ReplyChannel` object which takes care of the communication
from and to the RPC caller. From within the responding method, you communicate through the ``channel``
object with the calling party. The ``ReplyChannel`` object provides you with the following methods:

.. method:: reply(body)

    :param body: reply

    sends ``body`` as a reply back to the caller

    .. code-block:: python

        import lymph

        class EchoService(lymph.Interface):

            @lymph.raw_rpc()
            def echo(self, channel, text=None):
                channel.reply(text)


.. method:: ack(unless_reply_sent=False)

    :param unless_reply_sent: only send the acknowledgment if a reply has already been sent

    sends an acknowledgment to the caller.

.. method:: nack(unless_reply_sent=False)

    :param unless_reply_sent: only send the non-acknowledgment if a reply has already been sent

    sends a non-acknowledgment to the caller.

.. method:: error(body)

    :param body: error

    sends an error to the caller.

Sending RPC calls
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to send RPC calls from within lymph services, you need to pass the call through
the ``proxy`` class. You can obtain the system's proxy by calling the ``proxy`` method:

.. method:: proxy(address)

    returns a proxy object that can be used to conveniently send requests to
    another service.

    .. code-block:: python

        echo = self.proxy('echo')
        result = echo.upper(text='foo')
        assert result == 'FOO'

    This is equivalent to ``self.request('echo', 'echo.upper', text='foo')``.

The proxy object proxies any method that is called in the proxy class, into a corresponding
RPC call. It does not however make sure, that the RPC call actually exists. It will send the
call regardless of availability and timeout accordingly if no response is obtained.

Any value that is returned by the RPC call is also returned by the call to the corresponding
proxy method. In the example above, the service with the name ``echo`` provides the ``upper(text)``
endpoint. By calling the corresponding proxy method in the proxy object, the payload 
``text='foo'`` is sent to the endpoint and its result returned and saved in the ``result``
variable.

RPC calls are synchronous, i.e. program execution is halted until the RPC call returns an
answer or it times out. If you require asynchronous communication, please refer to 
:doc:`events`.


Command line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To send RPC calls from the command line to a lymph service, the following commands are
provided:

.. code:: bash

    $ lymph request

to send a RPC call and

.. code:: bash

    $ lymph inspect

to list all the available RPC methods of a given service.

lymph request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this command you can send a single RPC request to a given address. The
request message has to be JSON encoded. Usage of the ``lymph request`` command
is as follows:

.. code:: bash

    lymph request [options] [--ip=<address> | --guess-external-ip | -g] <subject> <params>

where

.. code::

    <subject>: the service namespace with the function to call (namespace.function)
    <params>:  the payload

    Options:
      --ip=<address>               Use this IP for all sockets.
      --guess-external-ip, -g      Guess the public facing IP of this machine and
                                   use it instead of the provided address.
      --timeout=<seconds>          RPC timeout. [default: 2.0]
      --address=<addr>             address of the service ('tcp://service_ip:port') or
                                   name of the service

Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ lymph request echo.upper '{"text": "foo"}'
    FOO

lymph inspect
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the inspect command, you can specify a service address and inspect which RPC calls are
possible with the service. The ``lymph inspect`` command is used as follows:

.. code:: bash

    Usage: lymph inspect [--ip=<address> | --guess-external-ip | -g] <address> [options]

where

.. code::

    <address>: the address of the service ('tcp://service_ip:port')

    Options:
      --ip=<address>               Use this IP for all sockets.
      --guess-external-ip, -g      Guess the public facing IP of this machine and
                                   use it instead of the provided address.

Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ lymph inspect "echo"

    rpc echo.upper(text)
        

    rpc echo.echo(text)
        Simple service relaying whatever comes in

    rpc lymph.status()
        

    rpc lymph.inspect()
        Returns a description of all available rpc methods of this service

    rpc lymph.ping(payload)
    

Inspect will list all the available methods of a service, together with its arguments and the short
docstring description if provided with the ``@lymph.rpc()`` decorator.
